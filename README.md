# Smart Calculator

## Introduction
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. I created one myself, and made it really special! 
In this project, I wrote a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember previous calculations.
Furthermore, this calculator can convert arithmetic expressions from infix notation to postfix notation. 
See [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

## Features
- save values to variables
- calculate arithmetic operations with integers and variables
- print the variables in memory
- delete variables from memory
- convert expressions from infix notation to postfix notation
- read a given file and update the variables
- write the variables in memory to a given file
- clear all variables from memory

## Example
`3 + 8 * ((4 + 3) * 2 + 1) - 6 / (2 + 1)`  
`121`
