# Smart Calculator

## About
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. I created one myself, and made it really special! In this project, I wrote a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember previous calculations.

Smart calculator can:
- print the variables in memory
- delete variables from memory
- convert expressions from infix notation to postfix notation
- read a given file and update the variables
- write the variables in memory to a given file
